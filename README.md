# Regularized Neural ODEs (RNODE)
This repository contains code for reproducing the results in "[How to train your Neural ODE: the world of Jacobian and Kinetic regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02798)".

## Requirements
- PyTorch 1.0+
- Install `torchdiffeq`, which provides Python CUDA ODE solvers, from [https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq)

## Examples
The paper applies regularized neural ODEs to density estimation and generative modeling using the FFJORD framework. Example training scripts for MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet64 and 5bit CelebAHQ-256 are found in `example-scripts/`

## Data preprocessing
Follow instructions in `preprocessing/`
